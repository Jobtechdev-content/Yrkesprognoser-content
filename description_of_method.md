# Method description for occupational forecasts

We start from SSYK2012 and merge some professions into larger professional groups (eg: Legal professions). The managerial occupations and occupations with less than 3,000 gainfully employed in the end of 2019 are merged into one "residual category". We have about 170 forecasting professions, including the residual category, which we forecast for two forecast years; 2022 and 2026. The forecast is based on two separate forecasts, one for supply and one for labor demand in each forecasting profession.

The supply of labor in the model consists of all gainfully employed. The gainfully employed population is divided into competence profiles based on educational level and educational orientation, as well as age. Based on historical data, we calculate flows in and out of these skills profiles and make a forecast of the number of gainfully employed in each profile with the help of Statistics Sweden's population forecasts. For the end year 2019, we calculate the proportion of gainfully employed in each competence profile per forecasting profession. These shares are then multiplied by the forecast for the number of individuals in the competence profile for forecast years 2022 and 2026.

Assumptions: We assume that the education dimensioning and preferences for different educations are constant over time. We also assume that the retirement age within the respective skills profile is constant over time and that employers' preferences regarding skills are constant. That is, the model does not (yet) take into account the shifts in skills [1].

Demand in the model consists of the number of gainfully employed in each profession and year and the number of job advertisements per profession. We make a forecast of the size of the profession in relation to total demand and demand per industry. Then we write down total demand per industry with the help of the trend and Statistics Sweden's population forecasts and make manual adjustments after qualitative assessments of the business cycle. We multiply the forecast occupational shares by the forecasts of the total number of gainfully employed in the industry.

Demand is set against supply and we produce a competition index for each profession and year.

[1] A model is a simplification of reality based on assumptions. To improve the model, we are developing it and hope to be able to take into account dynamics that we have currently chosen to keep constant. Even though we know that in some parts of the labor market there are skills shifts, we need to find a way where all professions are treated equally and we can take into account the skills shifts data-driven. This work is under development.
