Offers data regarding the assessed labor market situation for occupations in terms of competition and job opportunities in one and five years in the country. The long-term and short-term assessments are based on a model built by the analysis department with register data from Statistics Sweden on the Standard for Swedish occupational classification (SSYK2012), employment status, education and age and the Swedish Public Employment Service's activity statistics on job advertisements. The forecast is adjusted with the help of Statistics Sweden's population forecasts and economic assessments for the industries. The forecast is reported for approximately 180 forecasting professions, where a forecasting profession consists of one or more SSYK occupational groups.
